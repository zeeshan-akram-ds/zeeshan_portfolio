    "### Insights on Energy Consumption Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the Exploratory Data Analysis and model results, we can derive several insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Daily and Weekly Seasonality:** Energy consumption clearly shows daily and weekly patterns, with peaks during certain hours of the day and variations between weekdays and weekends. This highlights the importance of capturing these granular temporal features for accurate forecasting.\n",
    "*   **Yearly Seasonality:** There are noticeable seasonal variations throughout the year, likely influenced by weather conditions (heating/cooling) and holiday periods. Models that can capture yearly seasonality (like Prophet) are beneficial.\n",
    "*   **Impact of Missing Values:** The dataset contained missing values, which were imputed. The quality of imputation can significantly impact model performance, especially for time series data where continuity is important.\n",
    "*   **Model Strengths:**\n",
    "    *   **XGBoost:** Performed well, likely due to its ability to capture complex non-linear relationships and leverage engineered features effectively. Its tree-based nature makes it robust to outliers and non-normal data.\n",
    "    *   **Prophet:** Demonstrated good performance, particularly in handling seasonality and trends automatically, which are prominent in energy consumption data. Its ease of use and interpretability are also advantages.\n",
    "    *   **ARIMA:** While a strong baseline for time series, its performance might be limited by its linearity assumptions and the need for careful parameter tuning, especially in the presence of complex seasonalities and external factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning models in forecasting short-term household energy consumption. XGBoost and Prophet models generally outperformed ARIMA, indicating the value of incorporating rich time-based features and handling complex seasonal patterns. For practical applications, a hybrid approach combining statistical models with machine learning techniques, or ensemble methods, could further enhance forecasting accuracy."
